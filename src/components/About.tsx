          I&apos;m a Full Stack Developer with over 5 years of experience in building
          web applications. My journey in software development started with a
          passion for creating things that make a difference in people&apos;s lives.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
          I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, and modern web
          technologies. I&apos;m always eager to learn new technologies and best
          practices to deliver high-quality solutions.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source
          projects, writing technical blog posts, or exploring new technologies
          to stay at the forefront of web development.
